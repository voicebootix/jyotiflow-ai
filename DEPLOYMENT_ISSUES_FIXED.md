# Deployment Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Frontend API Calls Going to Wrong Domain
**Problem**: Frontend at `https://jyotiflow-ai-frontend.onrender.com` was making relative API calls that resolved to the frontend domain instead of the backend.

**Root Cause**: 
- Direct fetch calls without using the API base URL
- Missing or incorrect API_BASE_URL configuration

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated all fetch calls in components to use `API_BASE_URL`
- Fixed components:
  - `AdminPricingDashboard.jsx` - 9 API calls
  - `SystemMonitoring.jsx` - WebSocket URL
  - `Profile.jsx` - Cosmic insights API
  - `birthChartSessionService.js` - 2 API calls
  - `monitoring-fallback.js` - WebSocket and API calls

### 2. Incorrect Backend URL in render.yaml
**Problem**: `render.yaml` had `VITE_API_URL` pointing to `https://jyotiflow-backend.onrender.com` instead of the actual backend URL.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `render.yaml` to use correct backend URL: `https://jyotiflow-ai.onrender.com`

### 3. Smart Recommendations Endpoint Returning Null
**Problem**: `/api/spiritual/enhanced/pricing/smart-recommendations` was returning `null`.

**Root Cause**: Indentation error in `universal_pricing_engine.py` - the database query code was unreachable due to incorrect indentation after an early return statement.

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed indentation in `get_smart_pricing_recommendations()` function

### 4. WebSocket Connection Failures
**Problem**: WebSocket connections to monitoring endpoint were failing.

**Root Cause**: 
- WebSocket URLs were constructed using frontend domain
- Possible WebSocket support issues on hosting platform

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated WebSocket URL construction to use backend domain
- Added proper URL parsing to extract host from API_BASE_URL

## Backend CORS Configuration
**Status**: âœ… Properly configured
- CORS middleware includes `https://jyotiflow-ai-frontend.onrender.com` in allowed origins
- All environments (development, staging, production) include the frontend URL
- Credentials are allowed
- All methods and headers are allowed

## Action Required

1. **Redeploy Frontend on Render**:
   - The render.yaml has been updated with the correct backend URL
   - Trigger a new deployment to apply the changes

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly in Render dashboard if overriding render.yaml

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - After redeployment, clear browser cache to ensure new code is loaded

4. **Monitor WebSocket Support**:
   - Check if Render supports WebSocket connections
   - May need to enable WebSocket support in service settings

## Testing After Deployment

1. Check API calls are going to correct domain:
   ```javascript
   // Should see requests to https://jyotiflow-ai.onrender.com/api/...
   // NOT to https://jyotiflow-ai-frontend.onrender.com/api/...
   ```

2. Verify smart recommendations endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl https://jyotiflow-ai.onrender.com/api/spiritual/enhanced/pricing/smart-recommendations
   ```

3. Test WebSocket connection in browser console:
   ```javascript
   new WebSocket('wss://jyotiflow-ai.onrender.com/api/monitoring/ws')
   ```

## Summary
All code fixes have been applied. The main action needed is to redeploy the frontend with the corrected `VITE_API_URL` environment variable pointing to the actual backend URL.
