# Bug Fix Summary: EnhancedBirthChartCacheService Security Vulnerability

## Issue Description
The `_cache_complete_profile` method in `EnhancedBirthChartCacheService` was using `INSERT OR REPLACE` on the `users` table, which caused critical security and data integrity issues:

- **Data Corruption**: Existing user account details (name, password hash, role, credits) were being overwritten with temporary or default values
- **Security Vulnerability**: User password hashes were being replaced with hardcoded 'temp_hash' values
- **Account Compromise**: Users would lose access to their accounts as their credentials were corrupted

## Root Cause
The method was designed to cache birth chart data but was incorrectly using `INSERT OR REPLACE`, which:
1. Completely replaced existing user records instead of updating specific fields
2. Used hardcoded temporary values for critical account information
3. Didn't differentiate between new user creation and existing user updates

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the `_cache_complete_profile` method in `backend/services/enhanced_birth_chart_cache_service.py` (lines 461-481) to:

### 1. Check User Existence
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = ?", (user_email,))
user_exists = cursor.fetchone()
```

### 2. Update Existing Users Safely
For existing users, only update birth chart related fields:
```python
cursor.execute("""
    UPDATE users 
    SET birth_chart_data = ?, 
        birth_chart_hash = ?, 
        birth_chart_cached_at = ?, 
        birth_chart_expires_at = ?, 
        has_free_birth_chart = ?,
        birth_date = COALESCE(birth_date, ?),
        birth_time = COALESCE(birth_time, ?),
        birth_location = COALESCE(birth_location, ?)
    WHERE email = ?
""")
```

### 3. Preserve Critical Account Data
- **Password hashes**: Remain unchanged for existing users
- **User names**: Preserved from original registration
- **Roles and credits**: Maintain existing values
- **Account details**: Only update birth chart related fields

### 4. Safe New User Creation
For new users (rare case), insert complete record with proper validation:
```python
cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO users 
    (email, birth_chart_data, birth_chart_hash, birth_chart_cached_at, 
     birth_chart_expires_at, has_free_birth_chart, birth_date, birth_time, 
     birth_location, name, password_hash, role, credits, created_at)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
""")
```

## Key Improvements
1. **Data Integrity**: User account information is preserved
2. **Security**: Password hashes are never overwritten
3. **Functional Separation**: Birth chart caching vs. user account management
4. **Error Prevention**: Proper existence checks before operations
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing birth chart data structures remain unchanged

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test existing user registration flow
2. Test birth chart caching for existing users
3. Verify user login functionality after chart generation
4. Test edge cases with multiple chart generations
5. Verify data integrity across user sessions

## Files Modified
- `backend/services/enhanced_birth_chart_cache_service.py` - Fixed the `_cache_complete_profile` method

## Impact
- **Security**: Eliminated password corruption vulnerability
- **Data Integrity**: User accounts remain intact during birth chart operations
- **User Experience**: Users can access their accounts after chart generation
- **System Stability**: Prevents account lockouts and data loss

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
- Registration flow creates user accounts properly via `_create_user_account`
- Birth chart caching updates only chart-related fields
- User credentials and account data remain secure
- No `INSERT OR REPLACE` operations compromise existing data
