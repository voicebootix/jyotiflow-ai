# Database Self-Healing System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Schema Variable Scope Error ✅
**Error**: `cannot access local variable 'schema' where it is not associated with a value`

**Fix Applied**: 
- Initialized `schema` variable before the try block in the `check_health` method
- Added conditional checks to only process schema-related issues if schema analysis succeeded
- Added proper error handling for each schema analysis component

### 2. Schema Analysis Error Handling ✅
**Error**: `Schema analysis failed: "avg" is an aggregate function`

**Root Cause**: PostgreSQL's `pg_get_functiondef()` cannot be used with aggregate functions like `avg`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `_get_all_functions` query to exclude aggregate functions (`prokind != 'a'`)
- Added CASE statement to handle aggregate functions gracefully
- Added granular error handling in the `analyze_schema` method
- Each schema component (tables, columns, constraints, indexes, functions, triggers) now has individual try-catch blocks

### 3. CORS Configuration Enhancement ✅
**Issue**: Frontend at `https://jyotiflow-ai-frontend.onrender.com` getting CORS errors

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `expose_headers=["*"]` to CORS middleware configuration
- Verified CORS headers are being returned correctly (tested with curl)
- The API is actually working - the CORS error was a red herring

### 4. API Response Structure Fix ✅
**Issue**: I temporarily broke the `/api/database-health/issues` endpoint by changing its response structure

**Fix Applied**:
- Reverted the endpoint to return the full structure expected by the frontend
- Returns `critical_issues`, `warnings`, `issues_by_type`, and `summary` fields
- Maintains backward compatibility with the frontend

## Code Changes Summary

1. **database_self_healing_system.py**:
   - Line ~1172: Added `schema = None` initialization
   - Lines ~1200-1220: Wrapped schema issue detection in conditional check
   - Lines ~179-225: Added individual error handling for each schema component
   - Lines ~330-342: Fixed `_get_all_functions` to exclude aggregate functions
   - Lines ~1861-1945: Restored proper response structure for `/issues` endpoint

2. **main.py**:
   - Line ~341: Added `expose_headers=["*"]` to CORS middleware

## Status
✅ **All issues have been fixed!**

The system now:
- Handles the "avg is an aggregate function" error properly by excluding aggregates from function analysis
- Continues functioning even if schema analysis partially fails
- Returns proper CORS headers on all responses
- Provides the correct response structure expected by the frontend
- Logs errors without crashing the health check functionality

## Verification
Tested the API endpoint and confirmed:
- CORS headers are present: `access-control-allow-origin: https://jyotiflow-ai-frontend.onrender.com`
- The API returns the correct response structure
- No more "avg" aggregate function errors should occur
