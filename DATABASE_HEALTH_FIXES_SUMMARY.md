# Database Self-Healing System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Schema Variable Scope Error
**Error**: `cannot access local variable 'schema' where it is not associated with a value`

**Fix Applied**: 
- Initialized `schema` variable before the try block in the `check_health` method
- Added conditional checks to only process schema-related issues if schema analysis succeeded
- Added proper error handling for each schema analysis component

### 2. Schema Analysis Error Handling
**Error**: `Schema analysis failed: "avg" is an aggregate function`

**Fix Applied**:
- Added granular error handling in the `analyze_schema` method
- Each schema component (tables, columns, constraints, indexes, functions, triggers) now has individual try-catch blocks
- This prevents one component failure from breaking the entire schema analysis

### 3. CORS Configuration Enhancement
**Issue**: Frontend at `https://jyotiflow-ai-frontend.onrender.com` getting CORS errors

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `expose_headers=["*"]` to CORS middleware configuration
- Modified the `/api/database-health/issues` endpoint to return proper error responses instead of raising exceptions
- This ensures CORS headers are included even when errors occur

### 4. Improved Error Responses
**Enhancement**: Better error handling in API endpoints

**Changes Made**:
- The `/issues` endpoint now returns `{"issues": [], "error": "..."}` on errors instead of raising exceptions
- Database pool unavailability is handled gracefully with appropriate error messages

## Code Changes Summary

1. **database_self_healing_system.py**:
   - Line ~1172: Added `schema = None` initialization
   - Lines ~1200-1220: Wrapped schema issue detection in conditional check
   - Lines ~179-225: Added individual error handling for each schema component
   - Lines ~1830-1850: Improved error handling in `/issues` endpoint

2. **main.py**:
   - Line ~341: Added `expose_headers=["*"]` to CORS middleware

## Status
The fixes have been applied to handle the errors gracefully. The system should now:
- Continue functioning even if schema analysis partially fails
- Return proper CORS headers on all responses including errors
- Provide meaningful error messages instead of crashing

## Note on "avg" aggregate function error
The specific source of the "avg is an aggregate function" error was not found in the codebase. This might be coming from:
- A database view or function that uses avg incorrectly
- A dynamic query being generated elsewhere
- An issue with the PostgreSQL version or configuration

The error is now being caught and logged without breaking the health check functionality.
