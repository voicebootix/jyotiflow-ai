**Next Steps:** 
1. Discuss priorities with stakeholders
2. Plan phased implementation
3. Focus on consolidation before expansion
4. Leverage existing sophisticated backend capabilities

The vision is clear: **Transform JyotiFlow into the world's leading AI-powered spiritual guidance platform** through complete administrative control and strategic feature exposure.
