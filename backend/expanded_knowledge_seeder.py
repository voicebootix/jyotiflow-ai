                "content": "Carl Jung's psychological archetypes correspond remarkably with planetary symbolism in Vedic astrology. The Sun represents the Self and individuation process. Moon embodies the Anima/Animus and emotional patterns. Mars represents the Warrior archetype and assertive energy. Mercury symbolizes the Messenger and communication patterns. Jupiter embodies the Wise King/Teacher archetype. Venus represents the Lover and creative expression. Saturn symbolizes the Senex/Wise Elder and disciplinary aspects. This integration helps modern seekers understand planetary influences as internal psychological patterns rather than external fate, empowering conscious transformation.",
