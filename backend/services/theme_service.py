- Preserve identical skin tone, facial expression, and spiritual countenance
- Do not alter, morph, or change the face in any way whatsoever
- Face identity is completely protected from all theme transformations

CLOTHING TRANSFORMATION (PRIORITY 2):
- Transform clothing with intricate details and flowing fabric appropriate to the daily theme
- Add elaborate traditional patterns, rich textures, and authentic spiritual attire
- Remove current clothing completely and replace with theme-appropriate garments
- Apply vibrant colors and ornate designs matching the spiritual aesthetic

BACKGROUND TRANSFORMATION (PRIORITY 3):
- Create immersive spiritual environment that complements the daily theme
- Add natural elements like architectural details, stone carvings, peaceful water features
- Implement atmospheric lighting with golden hour ambiance and soft shadows
- Build serene setting that enhances the spiritual presence without overpowering
