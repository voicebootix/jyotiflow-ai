# 🚀 Building New Features

When asked to implement a feature:

- Ask for clarification if anything is ambiguous.
- Check if the logic already exists elsewhere in the project.
- Follow existing structure, style, and modularity.
- Leave clear comments and docstrings.

✅ Suggest a plan before you begin coding.

❌ Don’t introduce global state, hardcoded values, or mock logic unless explicitly asked.

# 💡 Dev Tip
- Treat Cursor like a junior dev. Be explicit, small scoped, and test-first.
