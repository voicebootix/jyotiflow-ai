---

# üß† Think First, Then Act
- Always understand the project context before making changes.
- Never suggest fixes without confirming the root cause.
- Respect architecture, naming conventions, and modularity.

# ‚ùå What NOT to Do
- Do not remove functionality just to eliminate an error.
- Do not add mock data, placeholders, or temporary patches.
- Do not duplicate code or simplify logic.

# ‚úÖ What TO Do
- Always ask for confirmation before applying changes.
- Leave inline comments explaining complex logic.
- If unsure about the impact, pause and escalate.
- Encourage writing or updating tests to validate logic.

# üí° Expert Tips
- Use Git or Cursor snapshots to back up before edits.
- Use tests + YOLO mode for safe debugging.
- Prompt AI like a junior developer: give clear, limited instructions.
