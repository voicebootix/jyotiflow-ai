## Testing Checklist

### 1. Backend API Endpoints Test

**Test the new services endpoints:**
```bash
# Test service types endpoint
curl -X GET "https://your-backend-url/api/services/types"

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "clarity",
      "display_name": "Clarity Plus",
      "description": "Essential spiritual guidance",
      "credits_required": 5,
      "price_usd": 9.99,
      ...
    }
  ]
}

# Test platform stats endpoint  
curl -X GET "https://your-backend-url/api/services/stats"

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalUsers": 150,
    "guidanceSessions": 420,
    "communityMembers": 80,
    "countriesReached": 15
  }
}

# Test credit packages endpoint
curl -X GET "https://your-backend-url/api/services/credit-packages"

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Starter Pack",
      "credits": 10,
      "price_usd": 9.99,
      "bonus_credits": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Frontend Service Loading Test

**Test that services load properly:**

1. Go to homepage - check that services display without errors
2. Go to `/spiritual-guidance` - verify services load correctly
3. Go to `/profile` - check services tab loads properly
4. Verify no console errors about failed API calls

**Expected Behavior:**
- Services should load from `/api/services/types` instead of admin endpoints
- Credit packages should load from `/api/services/credit-packages`
- Platform stats should show real numbers from database

### 3. Credit System Atomic Operations Test

**Test credit system integrity:**

1. **Create test user with limited credits:**
```sql
UPDATE users SET credits = 5 WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

2. **Test session creation:**
- Try to start a 5-credit service - should succeed
- Try to start another service immediately - should fail with proper error
- Verify credits were deducted correctly
- Verify session was created

3. **Test concurrent requests:**
- Simulate multiple requests to start sessions simultaneously
- Verify only one succeeds and credits aren't double-deducted

### 4. End-to-End Customer Flow Test

**Complete customer journey:**

1. **Homepage Visit:**
   - Verify real stats display (not 25000, 75000 fake numbers)
   - Check services display correctly
   - Verify no console errors

2. **Registration/Login:**
   - Create new account
   - Verify 5 free credits are added
   - Login works smoothly

3. **Service Selection:**
   - Go to spiritual guidance page
   - Verify services load with correct pricing
   - Check credit requirements display properly

4. **Session Creation:**
   - Fill out spiritual guidance form
   - Submit with sufficient credits
   - Verify session creates successfully
   - Check credits are deducted properly
   - Verify guidance is displayed

5. **Credit Purchase:**
   - Go to profile -> credits tab
   - Select a credit package
   - Verify purchase flow works
   - Check credits are added correctly

### 5. Error Handling Test

**Test error scenarios:**

1. **Insufficient Credits:**
   - Try to start session with 0 credits
   - Should show proper Tamil error message
   - Should not create session

2. **Invalid Service:**
   - Try to request non-existent service
   - Should handle gracefully

3. **Database Connection Issues:**
   - Simulate database downtime
   - Should show fallback data for stats
   - Should handle service loading failures

## Performance Tests

### Database Query Performance

**Check PostgreSQL query efficiency:**
```sql
-- Test the stats query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) as total_users,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions) as total_sessions,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days') as active_users,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SPLIT_PART(email, '@', 2)) FROM users) as countries_reached;

-- Test the credit deduction query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE UPDATE users SET credits = credits - 5 
WHERE id = 'test-user-id' AND credits >= 5;
```

**Expected Performance:**
- Stats query should complete in < 100ms
- Service types query should complete in < 50ms
- Credit deduction should complete in < 20ms

### Frontend Loading Performance

**Check frontend performance:**
1. Measure page load times for key pages
2. Check for unnecessary API calls
3. Verify no duplicate requests
4. Test mobile performance

## Security Tests

### SQL Injection Protection

**Test parameterized queries:**
```bash
# Try SQL injection in service name
curl -X POST "https://your-backend-url/api/sessions/start" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"service_type": "clarity'; DROP TABLE users; --"}'

# Should return error, not execute SQL
```

### Credit System Security

**Test credit manipulation attempts:**
1. Try to modify credits in frontend
2. Verify backend validates all credit operations
3. Test concurrent session creation attempts
4. Verify transaction rollback on failures

## Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **API Endpoint Success Rates:**
   - `/api/services/types` success rate
   - `/api/services/stats` success rate
   - `/api/sessions/start` success rate

2. **Credit System Metrics:**
   - Credit transaction success rate
   - Race condition incidents (should be 0)
   - Failed session creations due to credits

3. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Average response times
   - Database query performance
   - Frontend loading times

### Alerts to Set Up

1. **Critical Alerts:**
   - Service endpoint failure rate > 5%
   - Credit transaction failures > 1%
   - Session creation failures > 5%

2. **Performance Alerts:**
   - API response time > 2 seconds
   - Database query time > 500ms
   - Frontend loading time > 5 seconds

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   - Revert to previous API client with mock data
   - Disable new service endpoints
   - Restore frontend credit checking as backup

2. **Data Consistency:**
   - Check for any credit discrepancies
   - Verify all sessions were created properly
   - Audit transaction logs

## Success Criteria

✅ **All API endpoints respond correctly**
✅ **No more broken frontend calls to admin endpoints**  
✅ **Real statistics display instead of mock data**
✅ **Credit system is atomic and race-condition free**
✅ **End-to-end customer flow works smoothly**
✅ **Performance is acceptable (< 2s page loads)**
✅ **No SQL injection vulnerabilities**
✅ **Error handling is user-friendly**

## Expected Improvements

**Before Fixes:**
- Frontend errors calling non-existent endpoints
- Race conditions in credit system causing financial issues
- Fake statistics damaging credibility
- Confusing customer experience

**After Fixes:**
- 95%+ API success rate
- Zero credit race conditions
- Real, accurate statistics
- Smooth customer journey from homepage to session completion
- Professional, reliable experience

These fixes address the core issues that were breaking your customer flow and should result in significantly improved user experience and reduced support burden.
