# Sentry FastAPI Integration Bug Fix

## Issue Summary
The `sentry-sdk` dependency was updated from `sentry-sdk[fastapi]==1.40.0` to `sentry-sdk==2.8.0`, removing the `[fastapi]` extra. This extra provides FastAPI-specific integrations for error reporting, performance monitoring, and automatic request tracking. Without it, Sentry's FastAPI integration was broken, causing loss of:

- Error capture and reporting
- Performance monitoring 
- Request context tracking
- Automatic instrumentation

## Root Cause
The dependency was completely removed from `backend/requirements.txt` and there was no Sentry initialization code in the application, even though there was a `sentry_dsn` configuration option in the settings.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Restored Dependency with FastAPI Extra
**File**: `backend/requirements.txt` (line 32)
```
# তমিল - Logging and monitoring
structlog==23.2.0
sentry-sdk[fastapi]==2.8.0
```

### 2. Added Sentry Initialization Code
**File**: `backend/main.py` (lines 11-25)
```python
# Sentry initialization
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration

# Initialize Sentry if DSN is available
sentry_dsn = os.getenv("SENTRY_DSN")
if sentry_dsn:
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn=sentry_dsn,
        integrations=[
            FastApiIntegration(auto_error=True),
            StarletteIntegration(auto_error=True),
        ],
        traces_sample_rate=1.0,
        send_default_pii=True,
    )
    print("✅ Sentry initialized successfully")
else:
    print("⚠️ Sentry DSN not configured - skipping Sentry initialization")
```

## What the Fix Provides

### FastAPI Integration Features Restored
- **Automatic Error Tracking**: Unhandled exceptions in FastAPI routes are automatically captured
- **Performance Monitoring**: Request duration and performance metrics are tracked
- **Request Context**: Full request details (headers, body, params) are captured with errors
- **Automatic Instrumentation**: Database queries, external API calls, and other operations are tracked

### Starlette Integration Features
- **Middleware Integration**: Sentry middleware is automatically added to the ASGI application
- **WebSocket Support**: Error tracking for WebSocket connections
- **Static File Handling**: Proper handling of static file requests in error reporting

## Configuration
The fix uses the existing `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable for configuration:
- If `SENTRY_DSN` is set, Sentry will be initialized with full FastAPI integration
- If not set, the application will continue to work normally without Sentry

## Verification
✅ Package installs correctly with `sentry-sdk[fastapi]==2.8.0`
✅ FastAPI and Starlette integrations import successfully
✅ Sentry initialization code is properly integrated into application startup
✅ Graceful fallback when DSN is not configured

## Impact
This fix restores full error monitoring and performance tracking capabilities for the FastAPI application, ensuring that:
- Production errors are properly captured and reported
- Performance bottlenecks can be identified and monitored
- Request context is available for debugging
- The application maintains observability in production environments
