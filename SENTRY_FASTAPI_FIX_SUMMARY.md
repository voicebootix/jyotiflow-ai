# Sentry FastAPI Integration Fix Summary

## Problem
The FastAPI application was failing to deploy with the following error:
```
TypeError: StarletteIntegration.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'auto_enabling_integrations'
```

This error was occurring at line 21 in `/backend/main.py` during Sentry initialization.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by manually specifying Sentry integrations with explicit configuration when the FastAPI integration is designed to be auto-enabled by default. According to the official Sentry documentation, FastAPI integration is automatically enabled when FastAPI is detected in the project dependencies.

## Solution
Removed the manual integration specification and let Sentry auto-enable the FastAPI integration:

### Before (Problematic Code):
```python
# Sentry initialization
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration

# Initialize Sentry if DSN is available
sentry_dsn = os.getenv("SENTRY_DSN")
if sentry_dsn:
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn=sentry_dsn,
        integrations=[
            FastApiIntegration(auto_error=True),
            StarletteIntegration(auto_error=True),
        ],
        traces_sample_rate=1.0,
        send_default_pii=True,
    )
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```python
# Sentry initialization
import sentry_sdk

# Initialize Sentry if DSN is available
sentry_dsn = os.getenv("SENTRY_DSN")
if sentry_dsn:
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn=sentry_dsn,
        # FastAPI integration is auto-enabled by default when FastAPI is detected
        # No need to manually specify integrations unless custom configuration is needed
        traces_sample_rate=1.0,
        send_default_pii=True,
    )
```

## Key Changes Made
1. **Removed manual integration imports**: Eliminated the imports for `FastApiIntegration` and `StarletteIntegration`
2. **Removed integrations parameter**: Let Sentry auto-enable the FastAPI integration by default
3. **Simplified configuration**: Kept only the essential configuration parameters

## Benefits
- **Automatic integration**: FastAPI integration is now auto-enabled without manual configuration
- **Reduced complexity**: Simplified code with fewer imports and configuration
- **Better compatibility**: Follows Sentry's recommended best practices
- **Future-proof**: Will automatically work with future versions of Sentry SDK

## Technical Details
According to Sentry documentation:
- FastAPI integration is marked as "auto-enabled" 
- Auto-enabled integrations are automatically turned on when the corresponding framework is detected
- Manual specification is only needed when custom configuration options are required
- The `auto_enabling_integrations` parameter should be passed to `sentry_sdk.init()`, not to individual integrations

## Deployment Impact
This fix resolves the deployment failure and allows the FastAPI application to start successfully on Render or other deployment platforms.

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. The application should start without the TypeError
2. Sentry should automatically detect and enable FastAPI integration
3. Error tracking and performance monitoring should work as expected

This is a common issue when upgrading Sentry SDK versions or when manual integration configuration conflicts with auto-enabling features.
