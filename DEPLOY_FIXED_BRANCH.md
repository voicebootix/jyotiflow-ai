## ðŸŽ¯ PROBLEM CONFIRMED:
- **Production (render.com):** Running master branch (OLD CODE)
- **Fixed code:** In feature/social-media-save-json-serialization-fix branch  
- **Result:** Frontend can't parse backend responses â†’ "Failed to save configuration"

## âœ… SOLUTION 1: Update Render Deployment Branch

## âœ… SOLUTION 2: Merge to Master (Safer)

### Quick merge commands:

```

## ðŸŽ¯ AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
- âœ… Backend will return proper JSON: `{"success": true, "message": "..."}`
- âœ… Frontend will parse correctly
