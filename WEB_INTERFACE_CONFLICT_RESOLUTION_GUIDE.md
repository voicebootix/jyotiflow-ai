---

## 🔍 **What You'll See in Different Interfaces**

### **GitHub Interface**

#### **Scenario 1: Merge Conflict Resolution Page**
```
Files with conflicts:
📁 backend/jyotiflow.db

Conflict content:
[empty - file deleted]
```

**✅ Resolution:**
1. **Delete everything** between `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>`
2. **Leave the section completely empty**
3. **Click "Mark as resolved"**
4. **Commit the merge**

#### **Scenario 2: Pull Request Conflict Tab**
```
Conflicted files:
□ backend/jyotiflow.db

Options:
○ Use your version (delete file)     ← Choose this
○ Use their version (keep file)
○ Edit manually
```

**✅ Resolution:**
- **Select "Use your version"** (this keeps the file deleted)
- **Click "Resolve conflict"**

### **GitLab Interface**

#### **Scenario 1: Merge Request Conflicts**
```
Resolve conflicts:
📄 backend/jyotiflow.db

Conflict resolution:
[Left panel]: Your changes (empty)        ← Choose this side
[Right panel]: Their changes (file exists)

[Use left] [Use right] [Edit inline]
```

**✅ Resolution:**
- **Click "Use left"** (your changes = deleted file)
- **Click "Commit to source branch"**

#### **Scenario 2: Inline Editor**
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
[empty]
=======
[file content]
>>>>>>> master
```

**✅ Resolution:**
1. **Delete the entire conflict block** (all lines from `<<<<<<<` to `>>>>>>>`)
2. **Leave no content** (empty file = deleted file)
3. **Click "Resolve conflict"**

### **Bitbucket Interface**

#### **Scenario 1: Side-by-side view**
```
Source branch (yours):    Target branch (theirs):
[File deleted]            [File exists]

○ Take source             ○ Take target
```

**✅ Resolution:**
- **Select "Take source"** (deleted file)
- **Commit changes**

---

## 🚨 **Important: What NOT to Do**

### **❌ Wrong Actions:**
- **Don't select "Use their version"** (would restore SQLite file)
- **Don't select "Keep file"** (would break PostgreSQL migration)
- **Don't manually edit** to add content (file should be deleted)

### **❌ Common Mistakes:**
```
# WRONG - Adding content to "resolve" conflict
Some content here to resolve conflict

# WRONG - Keeping conflict markers
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
[content]
>>>>>>> master

# WRONG - Partial resolution
[some sqlite content]
```

### **✅ Correct Resolution:**
```
[completely empty - no content at all]
```

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Visual Guide**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Conflict Resolution**
- Go to your Pull Request / Merge Request
- Look for "Resolve conflicts" or "Conflicts" tab
- Click to enter conflict resolution mode

### **Step 2: Find the SQLite Database File**
- Look for `backend/jyotiflow.db` in the conflict list
- It will be marked as conflicted ⚠️

### **Step 3: Choose the Correct Resolution**
```
YOUR BRANCH (correct):     OTHER BRANCH (wrong):
[File deleted]             [File exists]
      ↓                          ↓
   ✅ Choose this          ❌ Don't choose this
```

### **Step 4: Apply the Resolution**
- Select your branch's version (deleted file)
- Or delete all content if using inline editor
- Ensure the file ends up completely removed

### **Step 5: Commit the Resolution**
- Click "Resolve conflict" or "Mark as resolved"

## 🎯 **Alternative: Command Line Resolution**

If the web interface is confusing, you can resolve via command line:

```bash
# 1. Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# 2. Check out your branch
git checkout your-branch-name

# 3. Merge or rebase the target branch
git merge origin/master
# OR
git rebase origin/master

# 4. When conflict appears, remove the file
git rm backend/jyotiflow.db

# 5. Complete the merge
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve conflict: Remove SQLite database after PostgreSQL migration"

# 6. Push to update the PR
git push origin your-branch-name
```

## 🔍 **Verification After Resolution**

### **Check 1: File Status**
In the web interface, verify:
- ✅ `backend/jyotiflow.db` is **not listed** in the final file tree
- ✅ No "Binary file" or "File exists" status

### **Check 2: Conflict Status**
- ✅ All conflicts should be marked as "Resolved"
- ✅ Green checkmark next to `backend/jyotiflow.db`
- ✅ "Ready to merge" status

### **Check 3: Changes Preview**
The PR should show:
```
Files changed:
❌ backend/jyotiflow.db (deleted)
✅ [other files with your changes]
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **If you can't find the right option:**
1. **Look for "Advanced" or "Manual" resolution options**
2. **Try the inline editor** - delete all content
3. **Use "Edit file" option** - make it completely empty
4. **Switch to command line** if web interface is limited

### **Common UI Labels:**
- "Use your version" = Delete file ✅
- "Use their version" = Keep file ❌
- "Take source" = Delete file ✅
- "Take target" = Keep file ❌
- "Accept current" = Delete file ✅
- "Accept incoming" = Keep file ❌

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You've resolved correctly when:
- ✅ **No SQLite file** in the final merge
- ✅ **PostgreSQL code** remains intact
- ✅ **No conflict markers** remain
- ✅ **PR shows file deletion**

---

## 📞 **Still Confused?**

If the web interface doesn't match these examples:
1. **Screenshot the conflict screen** and share it
2. **Use command line method** (more reliable)
3. **Check the platform's documentation** for conflict resolution
4. **Ask for help** with the specific interface you're using

**Remember: The goal is to keep the file DELETED, not to restore it.**
