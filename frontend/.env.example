# SECURITY NOTES:
# ================================
# 1. The VITE_ prefix makes these variables available in the browser
# 2. Never put secret keys or sensitive data in VITE_ variables
# 3. Sentry DSN is safe to expose as it only allows error reporting
# 4. Always use environment variables for configuration in production
# 5. Set these variables in your deployment platform's environment settings
