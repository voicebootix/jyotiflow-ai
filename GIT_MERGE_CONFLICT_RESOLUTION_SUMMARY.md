# Git Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Issue
The deployment was failing with a `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` at line 434 in `backend/main.py` due to unresolved Git merge conflict markers.

## Error Details
```
File "/opt/render/project/src/backend/main.py", line 434
    ^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

## Root Cause
The merge conflict occurred between two branches:
- **HEAD branch**: Added a Sentry test endpoint (`/test-sentry`)
- **cursor/evaluate-admin-dashboard-functionality-cadc branch**: Added an API health endpoint (`/api/health`)

## Resolution Applied
1. **Removed Git conflict markers**: 
   - `<<<<<<< HEAD`
   - `=======`
   - `>>>>>>> cursor/evaluate-admin-dashboard-functionality-cadc`

2. **Kept both endpoints** as they serve different purposes:
   - `/test-sentry` - Test endpoint for Sentry error tracking integration
   - `/api/health` - API health check endpoint for frontend compatibility

## Files Modified
- `backend/main.py` - Resolved merge conflict at lines 434-459

## Verification
- ✅ Python syntax check passed (`python3 -m py_compile backend/main.py`)
- ✅ No remaining merge conflict markers in project
- ✅ Both endpoints preserved and functional

## Impact
- **Deployment should now succeed** without syntax errors
- **All functionality preserved** from both branches
- **No breaking changes** to existing API endpoints

## Next Steps
The application should now deploy successfully on Render. If there are any remaining deployment issues, they would likely be related to dependencies or environment configuration rather than syntax errors.
