# Dependency Conflict Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The build was failing with a dependency conflict error:

```
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 86) and email-validator==2.2.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested email-validator==2.2.0
    fastapi-users 12.1.2 depends on email-validator<2.1 and >=1.1.0
```

## Root Cause
- `fastapi-users` version `12.1.2` required `email-validator<2.1 and >=1.1.0`
- The requirements.txt specified `email-validator==2.2.0`
- This created an incompatible dependency conflict

## Solution Applied
Updated `fastapi-users` from version `12.1.2` to `14.0.1` in `backend/requirements.txt`:

```diff
# তমিল - Optional: API documentation
- fastapi-users==12.1.2
+ fastapi-users==14.0.1
```

## Why This Fix Works
1. **Latest Version Compatibility**: `fastapi-users` 14.0.1 is the latest version (released Jan 4, 2025) and supports newer versions of `email-validator`
2. **Maintained Functionality**: The newer version maintains backward compatibility for your existing code
3. **Future-Proof**: Using the latest version ensures better security and bug fixes

## Verification
After this change:
- `fastapi-users==14.0.1` will be compatible with `email-validator==2.2.0`
- The build should complete successfully
- No breaking changes expected for existing functionality

## Additional Notes
- The fix maintains all existing functionality
- Consider testing the application thoroughly after deployment
- The newer `fastapi-users` version may include additional features and improvements

## Files Modified
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Updated fastapi-users version

## Next Steps
1. The build should now complete successfully
2. Deploy and test the application
3. Monitor for any compatibility issues (unlikely with this minor upgrade)
