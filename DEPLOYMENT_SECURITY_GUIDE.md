# üîí DEPLOYMENT SECURITY GUIDE - JYOTIFLOW

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY CHECKLIST

### **‚ö†Ô∏è  PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS**

Before deploying to production, **MUST** verify these security settings:

#### **1. Remove Testing Mode (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER set in production:
TESTING_MODE=true

# ‚úÖ Production should have:
TESTING_MODE=false
# OR completely remove TESTING_MODE environment variable
```

**Why Critical:** 
- `TESTING_MODE=true` bypasses admin authentication
- Creates security vulnerability in production
- Allows unauthorized access to admin endpoints

#### **2. Environment Variable Validation**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Required production settings:
ENVIRONMENT=production          # Enforces security checks
STABILITY_API_KEY=your_key     # Image generation
SUPABASE_URL=your_url          # Database
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_key  # Database access
JWT_SECRET=strong_secret       # Authentication security

# ‚ùå Remove from production:
TESTING_MODE=true              # Auth bypass - SECURITY RISK!
DEBUG=true                     # Disable debug in production
```

### **üîç Security Features Implemented**

#### **Environment-Based Auth Protection**
- **Production:** Full admin authentication enforced
- **Development:** `TESTING_MODE=true` allows controlled bypass
- **Validation:** Prevents bypass if `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- **Logging:** All bypass attempts logged for audit trails

#### **Code Location:**
```python
# backend/routers/social_media_marketing_router.py
async def get_admin_or_test_bypass():
    # Security validation prevents production bypass
    if environment in ["production", "prod"]:
        logger.warning("üö® SECURITY ALERT: TESTING_MODE bypass attempted in production")
        # Falls back to full authentication
```

### **üß™ Testing Setup (Development Only)**

#### **For Development/Testing:**
```bash
# Set environment variables for testing:
export TESTING_MODE=true
export ENVIRONMENT=development
export PYTHONPATH=backend

# Run tests:
python test_priority2_fix.py
```

#### **Test Scripts Setup:**
```bash
# Option 1: Set PYTHONPATH
PYTHONPATH=backend python test_priority2_fix.py

# Option 2: Run from project root with proper structure
python -m backend.test_priority2_fix
```

### **üîê Security Logging**

All authentication bypass attempts are logged:

```
üö® SECURITY ALERT: TESTING_MODE bypass attempted in production environment
üîì AUTH BYPASS ACTIVATED: Using TESTING_MODE in development environment
```

**Monitor these logs** for security audit trails.

### **üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] `TESTING_MODE` removed from production environment
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT=production` set
- [ ] All required API keys configured
- [ ] Security logging monitored
- [ ] Admin authentication working
- [ ] No debug modes enabled

### **üöÄ Deployment Commands**

#### **Safe Production Deploy:**
```bash
# 1. Verify no testing mode
echo $TESTING_MODE  # Should be empty or false

# 2. Set production environment
export ENVIRONMENT=production

# 3. Deploy application
# (your deployment commands here)

# 4. Verify auth security
curl -X POST /api/admin/social-marketing/generate-image-preview
# Should return 401 Unauthorized without proper admin token
```

### **üîß Emergency Security Disable**

If `TESTING_MODE` accidentally deployed to production:

```bash
# Immediately remove testing mode:
unset TESTING_MODE
# OR
export TESTING_MODE=false

# Restart application to apply changes
systemctl restart jyotiflow  # or your restart command
```

## **üìû Security Contact**

For security issues or questions:
- Review this guide before deployment
- Test authentication in staging first
- Monitor security logs after deployment

**Remember:** `TESTING_MODE=true` in production = **SECURITY VULNERABILITY** üö®

**Always verify** testing variables are removed before production deployment!
