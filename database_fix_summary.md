# Database Race Condition Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The `DynamicComprehensivePricing` class was creating its own database connection pool, competing with the main application's database connection during startup, causing TimeoutError.

## Solution (Complete Fix)

### 1. For API Usage (services.py)
- **Modified `DynamicComprehensivePricing.__init__()`** to accept a `db_connection` parameter
- **Updated `services.py`** to pass the existing database connection: `DynamicComprehensivePricing(db_connection=db)`
- **Uses main app's database connection** when called from API routes

### 2. For Standalone Module Functions
- **Fixed module-level functions** (`generate_pricing_recommendations`, `apply_admin_approved_pricing`, `get_pricing_dashboard_data`)
- **Create their own database connection** when called independently
- **Properly close connections** after use
- **Handle DATABASE_URL validation** with proper error handling

### 3. Database Access Pattern
- **API usage**: Uses passed connection from FastAPI dependency injection
- **Standalone usage**: Creates own connection and manages lifecycle
- **All methods**: Use `self.db_connection.fetchval()` directly (no pool management)

## Result
- ✅ No more competing database pools
- ✅ API routes use main app's database connection
- ✅ Standalone functions create their own connections
- ✅ Eliminates the race condition
- ✅ Proper connection lifecycle management
- ✅ Accurate dynamic pricing with real database data

## Files Changed
- `backend/dynamic_comprehensive_pricing.py` - Complete refactor to handle both usage patterns
- `backend/routers/services.py` - Pass database connection to pricing class

## Usage Patterns
```python
# API usage (services.py)
pricing = DynamicComprehensivePricing(db_connection=db)

# Standalone usage (module functions)
conn = await asyncpg.connect(DATABASE_URL)
try:
    pricing = DynamicComprehensivePricing(db_connection=conn)
    # ... use pricing
finally:
    await conn.close()
```

**Complete fix that handles all usage scenarios without duplication or race conditions.**
