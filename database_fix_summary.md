# Database Race Condition Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The `DynamicComprehensivePricing` class was creating its own database connection pool, competing with the main application's database connection during startup, causing TimeoutError.

## Solution (Complete Fix)

### 1. For API Usage (services.py)
- **Modified `DynamicComprehensivePricing.__init__()`** to accept a `db_connection` parameter
- **Updated `services.py`** to pass the existing database connection: `DynamicComprehensivePricing(db_connection=db)`
- **Uses main app's database connection** when called from API routes

### 2. For Standalone Module Functions
- **Fixed module-level functions** (`generate_pricing_recommendations`, `apply_admin_approved_pricing`, `get_pricing_dashboard_data`)
- **Use main app's database pool** via `get_db_pool()` and `db_pool.acquire()`
- **No separate database connections** - everything uses the same pool
- **Consistent with race condition fix** - single database connection source

### 3. Database Access Pattern
- **API usage**: Uses passed connection from FastAPI dependency injection
- **Standalone usage**: Uses main app's database pool (no separate connections)
- **All methods**: Use `self.db_connection.fetchval()` directly (no pool management)

## Result
- ✅ **Single database pool** - everything uses the main app's database pool
- ✅ **No competing connections** - eliminates race condition completely
- ✅ **API routes** use main app's database connection
- ✅ **Standalone functions** use main app's database pool
- ✅ **Proper connection lifecycle** managed by the main pool
- ✅ **Accurate dynamic pricing** with real database data

## Files Changed
- `backend/dynamic_comprehensive_pricing.py` - Complete refactor to handle both usage patterns
- `backend/routers/services.py` - Pass database connection to pricing class

## Usage Patterns
```python
# API usage (services.py)
pricing = DynamicComprehensivePricing(db_connection=db)

# Standalone usage (module functions)
await generate_pricing_recommendations()  # Acquires own connection
await apply_admin_approved_pricing(price, notes)  # Acquires own connection

# Nested usage (reusing existing connection)
db_pool = get_db_pool()
async with db_pool.acquire() as conn:
    pricing = DynamicComprehensivePricing(db_connection=conn)
    # Pass connection to avoid nested acquisition
    recommendations = await generate_pricing_recommendations(conn=conn)
    result = await apply_admin_approved_pricing(price, notes, conn=conn)
```

## Key Features
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - existing calls work without changes
- ✅ **Connection reuse** - functions accept optional connection parameter
- ✅ **No nested connections** - avoids connection pool exhaustion
- ✅ **Single database pool** - all connections from main app's pool

**Complete fix that handles all usage scenarios without duplication, race conditions, or nested connections.**
