# Database Race Condition Fix

## Problem
The `DynamicComprehensivePricing` class was creating its own database connection pool, competing with the main application's database connection during startup, causing TimeoutError.

## Solution (Surgical Fix)
1. **Modified `DynamicComprehensivePricing.__init__()`** to accept a `db_connection` parameter instead of creating its own pool
2. **Updated `services.py`** to pass the existing database connection: `DynamicComprehensivePricing(db_connection=db)`
3. **Removed all connection pool management** from the pricing class (no more `get_connection()`, `release_connection()`, etc.)
4. **Simplified database access** to use the passed connection directly: `self.db_connection.fetchval()`

## Result
- No more competing database pools
- Uses the main app's database connection
- Eliminates the race condition
- Simple and clean architecture

## Files Changed
- `backend/dynamic_comprehensive_pricing.py` - Simplified to use passed connection
- `backend/routers/services.py` - Pass database connection to pricing class

That's it. Simple, surgical fix without over-engineering.
