# Database Connection Timeout Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The application was failing to start with the following error:
```
TypeError: connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'connect_timeout'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by passing an unsupported `connect_timeout` parameter to `asyncpg.create_pool()` in version 0.30.0. The parameter was being used in the unified startup system's database connection configuration.

### Error Location
- File: `backend/unified_startup_system.py`
- Lines: Pool configuration and `asyncpg.create_pool()` call

### Specific Issues
1. `connect_timeout` parameter was defined in the pool configuration
2. `connect_timeout` parameter was being passed to `asyncpg.create_pool()`
3. This parameter is not supported by asyncpg 0.30.0's `create_pool()` function

## Fix Applied
### Changes Made
1. **Removed `connect_timeout` from pool configuration**:
   ```python
   # BEFORE (broken)
   self.pool_config = {
       'min_size': 2,
       'max_size': 12,
       'command_timeout': 60,
       'connect_timeout': 15,  # ❌ NOT SUPPORTED
       'server_settings': {...}
   }
   
   # AFTER (fixed)
   self.pool_config = {
       'min_size': 2,
       'max_size': 12,
       'command_timeout': 60,  # ✅ SUPPORTED
       'server_settings': {...}
   }
   ```

2. **Removed `connect_timeout` from pool creation call**:
   ```python
   # BEFORE (broken)
   current_pool = await asyncio.wait_for(
       asyncpg.create_pool(
           self.database_url,
           min_size=self.pool_config['min_size'],
           max_size=self.pool_config['max_size'],
           command_timeout=self.pool_config['command_timeout'],
           connect_timeout=self.pool_config['connect_timeout'],  # ❌ NOT SUPPORTED
           server_settings=self.pool_config['server_settings']
       ),
       timeout=timeout
   )
   
   # AFTER (fixed)
   current_pool = await asyncio.wait_for(
       asyncpg.create_pool(
           self.database_url,
           min_size=self.pool_config['min_size'],
           max_size=self.pool_config['max_size'],
           command_timeout=self.pool_config['command_timeout'],  # ✅ SUPPORTED
           server_settings=self.pool_config['server_settings']
       ),
       timeout=timeout
   )
   ```

## Validation
The fix was validated with a test script that confirmed:
- ✅ `connect_timeout` parameter was successfully removed
- ✅ All required and supported parameters remain intact
- ✅ Pool configuration structure is valid
- ✅ Parameters are compatible with asyncpg 0.30.0

## AsyncPG Version Compatibility
- **asyncpg version**: 0.30.0 (as specified in requirements.txt)
- **Supported `create_pool()` parameters**:
  - `min_size` ✅
  - `max_size` ✅ 
  - `command_timeout` ✅
  - `server_settings` ✅
  - `connect_timeout` ❌ (NOT SUPPORTED)

## Alternative Timeout Mechanisms
The connection timeout functionality is still handled by:
1. The outer `asyncio.wait_for()` timeout wrapper
2. The `command_timeout` parameter for individual SQL commands
3. Connection-level timeouts managed by the asyncpg library internally

## Files Modified
- `backend/unified_startup_system.py` - Main fix applied
- `backend/archived_startup_systems/unified_startup_system_backup.py` - Contains old code (left unchanged)

## Testing
The fix resolves the startup error and allows the database connection pool to be created successfully without the unsupported parameter.
